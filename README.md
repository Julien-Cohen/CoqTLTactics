# CoqTL

CoqTL is an internal language in Coq, for writing rule-based model- and graph- transformations. The language is associated with a library to simplify proving transformation correctness in Coq. 

For instance, here is the CoqTL code that transforms [Moore machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine) into [Mealy machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine) (if we disregard the first output symbol of the Moore machine).

```coq
Definition Moore2Mealy :=
  transformation
  [
    rule "state"
    from [Moore.StateClass]
    to [
      elem "s"
        (fun _ _ s => BuildState (Moore.State_getName s)) nil
    ];
    rule "transition"
    from [Moore.TransitionClass]
    to [
      elem "t"
        (fun _ m t => 
          BuildTransition 
            (Moore.Transition_getInput t)
            (value (option_map Moore.State_getOutput (Moore.Transition_getTarget t m))))
        [
          link
            (fun tls _ m moore_tr mealy_tr =>
              maybeBuildTransitionSource mealy_tr
                (maybeResolve tls m "s" Mealy.StateClass 
                  (maybeSingleton (Moore.Transition_getSourceObject moore_tr m))));
          link 
            (fun tls _ m moore_tr mealy_tr =>
              maybeBuildTransitionTarget mealy_tr
                (maybeResolve tls m "s" Mealy.StateClass 
                  (maybeSingleton (Moore.Transition_getTargetObject moore_tr m))))
        ]
  ]
].
```

## Organization of the repository 

* [core/](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl/tree/master/core) - contains the source files of the CoqTL engine.
* [transformations/](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl/tree/master/transformations) - contains sample CoqTL transformations and associated proofs.
* [libs/](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl/tree/master/libs) - contains an importer that translates `ecore` metamodels and `xmi` models into Coq. While not necessary to run CoqTL, the sources of the importer are in the [coqtl-model-import](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl-model-import) repository.
* [.vscode/](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl/tree/master/.vscode) - define convenience tasks for vscode to `recompile`, `clean`, `execute code generator`.

## Installation

CoqTL requires a working installation of [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) (`coqc` and `coq_makefile` in the path). It is tested under Coq 8.15.0.

To install CoqTL:
```
git clone https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl.git
cd coqtl
./compile.sh
```
