# CoqTL

CoqTL allows users to develop model transformation engines, write model transformations, and prove engine/transformation correctness in Coq. 

```
Definition Moore2Mealy :=
    transformation

      rule "state"
      from [Moore.StateClass]

## Organization of the repository 

* Folder [core](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl/tree/master/core) - contains the source files for CoqTL engine.
* Folder [transformations](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl/tree/master/transformations) - contains sample CoqTL transformations and their proofs.
* Folder [libs](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl/tree/master/libs) - contains a code generator to translate `xmi` and `ecore` files into Coq. While not necessary to run CoqTL, the sources of the generator are in the [coqtl-model-import](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl-model-import) repository.
* Folder [.vscode](https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl/tree/master/.vscode) - contains a task file for vscode user to `recompile`, `clean`, `execute code generator`.

## Installation

CoqTL requires a working installation of [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) (`coqc` and `coq_makefile` in the path). It is tested under Coq 8.15.0.

To install CoqTL:
```
git clone https://github.com/atlanmod/coqtl.git
cd coqtl
. compile.sh
```
